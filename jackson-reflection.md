# Reflection Questions
1. The git concepts I struggled with the most were the proper workflow for pushing and pulling files.
2. Proper syntax for naming commit messages, overall git workflow, working through merge conflicts.
3. What does it mean to "git fetch", when to perform a git push <master> versus git push <branch name>
4. I'm still trying to get used to using proper git workflow when working with another person on the same repo.
5. Good! I was able to learn a lot from the guide as well as bounce ideas and reinforce concepts with my partner.
