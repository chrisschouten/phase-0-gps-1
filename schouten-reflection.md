#Reflection
1. I had struggled with the order of steps of git workflow.
2. The proper git workflow is now more clear as well as best practices. 
3. I asked my pair about the specific git workflow steps.  I also asked the guide about her job hunting experience.
4. I still need to memorize the steps in proper git workflow.
5. My first experience pairing in a GPS was very informative and I learned a few new tricks.
